# Dockerfile

# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the dependency file and install dependencies
# This is done in a separate step to leverage Docker's layer caching.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the rest of your application code into the container
COPY . .

# 5. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# 6. Define the command to run your app using uvicorn
#    --host 0.0.0.0 makes the server accessible from outside the container.
